# Enigma Showdown
Enigma Showdown is a framework for allowing anyone to create an AI to play a real time game.
This codebase contains that framework, along with the game, Enigma Showdown: Conquest.
Conquest is a game fully implemented using the framework.

## Who is this game for?

This game is for anyone who wants to improve their programming skills by solving puzzles that require
you to write code to control a player to solve those puzzles!
This is targeted at intermediate level programmers,
but should also be fun for advanced programmers who want to compete for the fastest time in a given leve.


## About this game

When you start to play this game, you must choose a level that you want to create a bot for.
If you want a challenge, you may choose to create a bot that can react to its environment and complete any level.

Components in each level include:

* Pushing crates onto a pressure plate to open a door
* Taking damage from fire
* Using water to put yourself out from the fire


## Playing the Game

The game is played by writing code to control the player.
For best support, you may choose Kotlin or Java as your language.
Python and C++ are also supported.

## Getting Started with Kotlin or Java

To get started with Kotlin or Java, use [template-jvm](https://github.com/EnigmaShowdown/template-jvm)
as a template to create a repository containing boilerplate code to get you started.


## Getting Started with Python or C++

The Python and C++ repositories do not currently have template repositories to help get you started.
To play the game using either of these languages, you may clone their client repositories and edit the code inside of them:

* https://github.com/EnigmaShowdown/python-client
* https://github.com/EnigmaShowdown/cpp-client
