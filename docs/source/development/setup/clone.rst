Clone the project
=================

This page shows you how to clone the project.

Make sure that you have a GitHub account created.
Then, confirm that you are a part of the `EnigmaShowdown organization <https://github.com/EnigmaShowdown>`_.
If you are not a part of the organization, reach out to Lavender Shannon so she can get you added to the org.

Now, you may decide how you want to configure your computer for `Authentication <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication>`_.
`Generating a new SSH key <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>`_
is generally the easiest way to get set up.

`cd` to a directory of your choice, and run **one of** these two commands:

.. code-block:: shell

  # for personal access tokens or read-only access
  git clone https://github.com/EnigmaShowdown/enigmashowdown

  # for SSH keys
  git clone git@github.com:EnigmaShowdown/enigmashowdown.git

Since this is a public repository, you won't be able to confirm if you have write access until you actually try to push changes to the repository.
