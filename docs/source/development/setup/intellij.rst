IntelliJ
=========

IntelliJ is the IDE that best supports Kotlin development.

Installing IntelliJ
---------------------

You could instlal IntelliJ directly, but I recommend installing `Jetbrains Toolbox <https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/>`_ to manage your install.
If you would like, you can sign up with your school email and get access to paid features of JetBrains products,
but the free IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition is more than enough to get the job done.

Opening the Project
--------------------

You should already have the project cloned somewhere. When prompted to open a project by IntelliJ, you may open an existing project.
Navigate to where you cloned the project, click on the `enigmashowdown` directory and then click "open".
